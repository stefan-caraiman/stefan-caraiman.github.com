This blog post serves as an insight into the implementation details that went into my recent demo presentation about IFTTT, Goggle Assistant, Gitlab and Terraform and to also offer additional side details and views on these topics.


## Why?


## How?


## Conclusion

Although smart device integrations is seen as something still in the maturity phase, the integrations and services available at the moment all work almost flawlessly and cover up a large portion of what any business looks to adopt in their life cycles.

My view is that we should try and drive this new "revolution" as it proves that it can bring a lot of initial value to any kind of project, especially in making the working environment feel more *interactive*.
